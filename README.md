# GoldenNest Project

GoldenNest is a backend application developed with **Java Spring Boot**, integrating modern technologies such as **JWT**, **Docker**, **MinIO**, **Flyway**, **Mail SMTP**, and **WebSocket**. The application connects to a frontend built with **ReactJS**, supporting **CORS** to ensure secure connections.

- **Mail SMTP**: Sends account confirmation and notification emails.
- **WebSocket**: Enables real-time communication.
- **Docker**: Packages and deploys the application efficiently.
- **CORS**: Ensures secure connections between backend and frontend.

### Frontend
- **ReactJS**: Creates the user interface and connects to the backend via APIs.
